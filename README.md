# Performance Hud for SwiftUI

![CleanShot 2025-06-19 at 09 29 09@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/566fe067-d86e-4177-8959-eb47c18f47f6)

Tiny overlay for SwiftUI that shows live FPS and memory so you can spot frame drops before users do. Inspired by React Nativeâ€™s Perf Monitor, built with only public iOS APIs.

## Usage

```swift
import PerformanceHUD


.overlay {
    PerfHUD() // init also exposes position and chart type
}
```
